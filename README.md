# Etch-A-Sketch

This project comes from the Odin Project curriculum. It took me forever on how to figure out how to add a drawing function and implement it properly, but i got the mini drawing app working finally after a week of trial and error. There was a mini bug where the border color and pen color wouldn't stay the same when the grid size changed. After all, this project was fun and I'm happy how it turned out.

## What I learned
- More Advanced DOM techniques
- Different ways to style a web page
- Improved UI and UX design
- Deeper understanding of javascript
